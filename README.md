# Finny - Your Loan Knowledge Assistant ðŸ¤–

## Overview

Finny is a smart, AI-powered chatbot designed to provide instant loan-related assistance. It combines a **dynamic knowledge base** with **real-time AI-generated responses** to help users get accurate information about loans, credit scores, interest rates, and more.

## Features

### 1. **Dynamic Knowledge Base (FAISS-powered Retrieval System)**
- Finny stores a **knowledge base** of predefined loan-related information using the **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector store**.
- **How it works:**
  - When a user asks a question, the system searches the **most relevant** answer from the knowledge base.
  - If an answer is found, it is **displayed instantly**.
  - If no answer is found, Finny **intelligently learns** the new query over time and expands its knowledge base.

### 2. **AI-Powered Chatbot (Google Gemini AI Integration)**
- If a user asks a question **not covered** in the knowledge base, Finny will generate a response using **Google Gemini AI**.
- **How it works:**
  - The chatbot sends the question to **Google Gemini AI**.
  - The AI generates an **accurate, context-aware response**.
  - This ensures Finny is **always up-to-date** with the latest information.

### 3. **Question Tracking & Automatic Learning**
- Finny keeps track of **frequently asked questions**.
- If a question is asked **5 or more times**, it is **automatically added** to the knowledge base.
- This helps Finny continuously **learn and improve** without manual updates.

### 4. **Real-time Chat UI with Streamlit**
- Finny provides a **smooth, interactive chat experience** using **Streamlit**.
- **How it works:**
  - The chatbot interface is built using **Streamlit chat components**.
  - Messages are displayed in **separate user and assistant chat bubbles**.
  - Users can type their questions and receive **instant responses**.

### 5. **Planned Enhancements (Future Features)**
- **Voice Support**: Users will be able to **speak** their questions instead of typing.
- **Loan Calculation Tools**: Users will be able to calculate **interest rates, EMI, and loan eligibility**.
- **Multilingual Support**: Finny will support **multiple languages** to help a wider audience.
